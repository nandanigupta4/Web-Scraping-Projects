This example scrapes the BBC weather website for any specific city, and collects weather forecast for the next 14 days and saves it as a csv file.

Web scraping might not be legal always. It is a good idea to check the terms of the website you plan to scrape before proceeding. Also, if your code requests a url from a server multiple times, it is a good practice to either cache your requests, or insert a timed delay between consecutive requests.
